AnimationState state = ...
state.addListener(new AnimationStateAdapter() {
    public void event (int trackIndex, Event event) {
        // Inspect and respond to the event here.
        if (event.name == "footstep")
            Audio.play("footstep" + event.intValue + ".wav");
    }
});
A callback can also be set on an individual TrackEntry:

TrackEntry entry = state.setAnimation(0, "run", true);
entry.setListener(new AnimationStateAdapter() {
    public void event (int trackIndex, Event event) {
        // Inspect and respond to the event here.
        if (event.name == "audio")
            Audio.play(event.stringValue);
    }
});
